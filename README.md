Cricket Statistics LLM Chatbot
This project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as an expert cricket statistics analyst. The chatbot processes natural language prompts from users and converts them into efficient Python code using Pandas. The code is designed to interact with a comprehensive cricket match dataset stored in a CSV file, enabling data filtering, aggregation, and manipulation based on user requests.

Key Features:

Natural Language Processing: The chatbot understands user prompts related to cricket statistics and generates accurate, executable Pandas code.
Comprehensive Cricket Analysis: Supports a wide range of cricket statistics queries, such as player performance, bowling economy, match-specific data, and more.
Optimized for Large Datasets: The project includes strategies to handle large CSV files efficiently.
Interactive and User-Friendly: Provides quick and reliable insights into cricket data, making it an essential tool for cricket analysts and enthusiasts.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core language used for coding.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
Google Gemini Pro LLM: Converts natural language questions into Pandas code.
Streamlit: For building an interactive user interface.
